# RockPaperChess
unity project about rock paper chess

TODO

- make working prototypes for rock paper scissors

- and 5x3 chess
- rook, queen, pawns

when a piece takes, the scene changes to a rock paper scissors. whoever is victorious if now their turn, and takes the place of the opponent's piece.

this allows for a potential "unfair" game where the winner only plays for an entire round.
